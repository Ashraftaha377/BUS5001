Property Price Assessment Using Predictive Modelling
This project uses a data-driven approach to predict property prices based on 113 variables describing property sales. The dataset includes 3970 property sales between 2006 and 2010. The goal is to build and evaluate predictive models for the property assessorâ€™s office, demonstrating the feasibility of using predictive modeling for property price assessments.
## How It Works

1. The dataset is processed using Python.
2. A simple linear regression model is used to predict the property prices.
3. A Decision Tree model is also used.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g.,'pandas', 'scikit-learn')
3. Run the script


## Data

The data used is provided in `data/HousingValuation.csv`. The dataset contains various variables such as lot area, overall quality, year built, and sale price. You can find a full description of the variables in `data_description.txt`.
